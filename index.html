        <h2>Writeup</h2>
        <p>This project explores the differences between self-reported stress levels and actual stress indicators. Using data visualization techniques, we analyze how individuals perceive their stress compared to physiological or behavioral stress markers.</p>
        <p>We use survey data where participants rate their stress on a scale, alongside objective measures such as heart rate variability, sleep patterns, and cortisol levels. Our findings highlight discrepancies between subjective perception and biological responses, providing insights into stress awareness and management.</p>
        <p>Through interactive visualizations, we aim to help users understand these differences and encourage more accurate self-assessment of stress levels.</p>
